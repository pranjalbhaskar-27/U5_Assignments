      Our plans to focus on sustainability at PenPlace include:</h1>
      <p width="50%">
Committing to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the U.S. Green Building Council.
Integrating strategic climate-responsive design for our office buildings, including high-performance glazing and built-in solar shading that will reduce the need for building heating and cooling, targeting a savings of 30% over the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) baseline.
Providing more than 125 electric vehicle charging stations, with the ability to double capacity as needed.
Leveraging low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water usage to reduce water consumption by 50% beyond national standards.
Reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the concrete structure compared to typical construction practices by at least 10%, along with a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining embodied carbon from building materials.
Using bird-safe glass where appropriate on all seven buildings at PenPlace to ensure that the development is safer for the regionâ€™s bird population.
